# Halloween Theme Requirements - "The Necromancer's Quill"

## Project Overview
Transform the AI Humanizer into a Halloween-themed experience called "The Necromancer's Quill" that resurrects "dead" AI text into living, human-like writing.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette - "Graveyard at Midnight"
- **Primary (Ghostly Purple)**: #8b5cf6 - Necromancer's magic
- **Accent (Toxic Green)**: #22c55e - Life force, resurrection
- **Warning (Blood Orange)**: #f97316 - Caution states
- **Error (Crimson Red)**: #ef4444 - AI detection, cursed text
- **Background**: Deep darkness (#0a0a0f, #13131a, #1a1a24)

### Typography
- **Sans**: Inter - Clean, readable body text
- **Display**: Creepster - Spooky headers only
- **Mono**: Courier Prime - Code and stats

### Animation Principles
- Smooth, ghost-like movements
- Floating particles (ghosts)
- Pulsing glows on interactive elements
- Tombstone-rising card animations
- Spell circle rotations

## User Experience Goals

### Playful but Professional
- Halloween theme should enhance, not distract
- Clear value proposition maintained
- Accessible despite dark aesthetic
- Fast performance (no heavy animations blocking)

### Narrative Integration
- "Resurrect" instead of "humanize"
- "Curse" instead of "AI detection score"
- "Spell" instead of "template"
- "Ritual" instead of "process"
- "Graveyard" for history
- "Potion Lab" for A/B testing

## Core Features

- Split-pane layout with glow effects
- Left: "Cursed Text" (AI input) with red glow
